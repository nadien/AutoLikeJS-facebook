# AutoLike JS facebook
This is a box front end made in javscript, it have native function of Facebook.

The styles can be different in each page, so, i recommend you take a look on it.

The script only works when the users are logued in, it looks like this:

You only have to put the tags in your global index header:
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.2.min.js"></script>
 <script src="engine.js"></script> 
<script src='http://connect.facebook.net/es_ES/all.js#xfbml=1'></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="estyles.css">

I tried "autolikeJS" in one of my page and the likes go up as 5% . It deppends your content and traffic
So, enjoy it.
